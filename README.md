# react-gm-erosion-waterfall-chart
A waterfall chart to show Gross Margin (GM) erosion via different types of discounting from the standard price, culminating in the actual GM a company can expect.

React has been used to make the chart & associated data easily editable, so that the effects can be seen of various data sets.
